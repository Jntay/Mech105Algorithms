# Mech105Algorithms
Jason Taylor
---
This folder contains all of the algorithms that I created during my time at Colorado State University in Mech 105 (Spring 2023). Algorithms made here are strictly made through MATLAB. The folder includes 
root finding methods such as **bisection** and **false position** methods. It also includes **LU factorization** for solving systems, a **linear reagression** function, and **Simpson's 1/3 method** for numerical integration.
